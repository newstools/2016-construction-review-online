Namibia s Roads Authority (RA) has allocated a massive US$39.1 million for road rehabilitation in Ohangwena Oshana and Oshikoto, as well as the two Kavango Regions.This program will kick off in Oshana Region and will later be rolled out to other regions.A contractor has already been selected to work on the Oshakati-Outapi road at a cost of N$8 million. Another project to be done in Oshana Region is the rehabilitation of the Oshakati-Okahao road, which will be done for N$45 million.Roads Authority Chief executive officer (CEO), Conrad Lutombi said the rehabilitation of roads was initiated so as to improve the lifespan and quality of the roads.At the moment, rehabilitation is going on between Oshakati and Oshikuku, where the roads&#8217; lifespan is scheduled to be raised to at least eight years.Lutombi revealed this when he visited Governor of Oshana Region Clemens Kashuupulwa to update him on the progress of the roads being rehabilitated in Oshana. He said the Omungwelume road is scheduled to be handed over by September, while the Okatana-Endola Onhuno road is scheduled to be handed over by November.Governor Kashuupulwa noted that work on the road is going on at a very slow pace. &#8220;There are always people on site, but they are just very slow,&#8221; he opined.In turn the CEO said that the two roads would be completed on time as scheduled, and added that they are working to iron out all the setbacks. &#8220;We&#8217;re making extensive progress at Okatana-Endola-Onhuno road and we&#8217;re currently just doing final touches. We have already opened 25 km of the road to traffic,&#8221; he explained.Another road construction project said to be making progress is the gravel road connecting Uukwiyu-Uushona to Omuntele Constituency.Also in the pipeline, is the construction of the about 4 km dual carriageway between Okatan and Oshakati, which it is hoped will ease traffic congestion on that route.Currently, RA is busy negotiating compensation for those living nearby who will be affected.Lutombi said there are also plans to expand the Natis office at Ongwediva, as the current facility cannot handle the pressure. &#8220;In future we&#8217;re also planning to put up a Testing Centre in Ondangwa,&#8221; he said.RA has also given priority to the construction of roads leading to schools and clinics in the region. Governor Kashuupulwa said he was happy with the ongoing infrastructural developments in the region.&nbsp;
