The Rwandan Government through a good will agreement with China has decided to construct a US$ 27m modern 5-storey complex in Rwanda to serve as Administrative Office Complex for the Prime Minister, other ministries and government institutions. This news was confirmed by Zhang Dejiang, the Chairman of the standing committee of the National People’s Congress of China (NPC), who is in Rwanda for an official visit, cut the ribbon and commissioned the construction of the facility. During the visit, Zhang Dejiang also met President Paul Kagame where they discussed on cooperation agendas on how China can support Rwanda to cut the widening trade deficit since China is Rwanda’s key investment and cooperation partner. The decision of the construction of the complex came as a sign of good will and cementing cooperation between the two countries. Rwanda’s Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo was pleased with the visit by China’s 3rd high ranking official and his delegation and said that the visit will strengthen relations between the two countries, including collaboration on global matters. “We are pleased with this visit by the Chinese Government and we are sure that this initiative will strengthen relations between us, including collaboration on global matters,” Mushikiwabo said. Rwanda and China have enjoyed good bilateral ties since 1971. Chinese investments in Rwanda have reached US$ 200m in the last five years covering different sectors of the country including ICT, construction, manufacturing, hotels and restaurants, finance among others but Rwanda remains the largest source of commodities imports. However, Chinese companies run mega construction and irrigation projects in different parts of the country. The two day visit by the Chinese delegation was also part of a follow up on commitments made by China’s president Xi Jinping, including a US$ 60bn fund, during the China-Africa Summit in Johannesburg last year in December.
