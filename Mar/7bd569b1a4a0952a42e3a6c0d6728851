2100kg shuttering magnet widely used in prestressed concrete system construction. It’s consist of powerful neodymium magnets and housing steel box. Meanwhile, in order to pretect the inside magnet from rusting and damagement, it’s poured with black epoxy material between magnet and steel
parts. The workers could easily push or pull the above button to make the magnetic box performed adhesive force or not with a steel sticker.
