The ongoing construction of the Rwanda International cricket stadium will be completed 2018 but it will however be operational in 2017. Rwanda international cricket stadium foundation General Manager, Mr. Eric Dusingizimana has said the stadium will be ready for use by January 2017 although its full completion is expected for early 2018. Construction of the US$ 1.2m stadium begun early last month and is being developed in Gahanga sector, Kicukiro district and the developers are almost through with the first phase of the project. “We are almost done with the first phase of the project which generally entails clearing and planting grass and when the sports ground is done the teams will be allowed to start using it as work on the entire stadium continues,” Mr. Dusingizimana said. The initiative of the cricket stadium is hoped to increase the awareness of cricket in Rwanda since it is one of the most progressive sports in the country. The sport has grown tremendously and has become a very popular activity in most schools in the country. More sporting facilities will also be needed to make the sport a success and also attract more interested talents to participate in the game. At the moment, close to US$600,000 has been mobilized for the construction of phase one of the mega new development but the complete project is projected to cost US$ 1.2m. The news of the stadium has been received with open arms and recently while Mr. Dusingizimana was on a trip to England, he was invited to a fundraising dinner where US$ 178,861 was raised towards the idea of building the first cricket stadium in Rwanda. According to reports, the charity is run by a team of cricket fanatics from the UK Christopher Shale and Rwanda in corporation with the Marylebone Cricket Club Foundation.
